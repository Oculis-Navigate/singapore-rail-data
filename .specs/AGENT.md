Make sure to use uv to handle dependencies and to run scripts. Do not rely on python and pip directly!

When working on a feature, always start by creating a new branch named with the following naming convention:
- <type>/<name>

where type is one of:
- feat
- chore
- bugfix

and name is a descriptive name for the feature taken directly from .specs
each git commit should be descriptive and explains whats going on
